Make PG, PG again

Prince George County continues to have the second highest crime rate in the state of Maryland. However there are very few tools that provide residents and visitors the ability to check these statistics. So the problem we were trying to solve is providing tools that would allow people to be aware of the crime rate statistics in certain areas of PG County. They would be allowed to filter through the types of crime they want information on as well as inputting the street number and address to narrow down the search.

The stakeholders would be the local government, the citizents in PG County, as well as the visitors. The target browser would be any accessible web browser.
The data we chose to work with is from PG's Crime Incident database (link - https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents-February-2017-to-Present/wb4e-w4nf/data)
Our chosen strategy was connection the JSON to our HTML and then using JavaScrypt to filter through that data so that user will be able to filter through the specifics.
